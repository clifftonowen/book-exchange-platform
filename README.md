# üìö P2P Book Exchange Platform: Giving Books a Second Life (Proof of Concept)

## üìñ Project Overview

In an increasingly digital world, many physical books end up unread on shelves. This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Book Exchange Platform aimed at giving these neglected books a second life. It connects readers, promotes a culture of sharing and sustainability, and reduces waste by facilitating easy book exchange.

This web application demonstrates a seamless user journey from listing a book to completing an exchange, incorporating key community features and a touch of innovation to highlight its market potential.
